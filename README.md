This Python script captures network traffic for a specified duration using the Scapy library, processes the captured packets, extracts information such as source IP, destination IP, protocol, and website names (from URLs), and performs basic data cleaning tasks on the captured data.

# Features
I uploaded 5 pages of the CSV file as a PDF since the original CSV file was too large.
For the actual project submission, I will shorten or compress the data.
